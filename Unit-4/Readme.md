Programs:
1. Class named circle constructed by a radius and two methods which will compute the area and the perimeter of the circle.
1. Class called country, which represents a country with a name, a population, and an area. Define country with a constructor that has four parameters: country, name, population and its area.
1. Program that describes the class rocket with its attributes as x and y values. Create a fleet of 5 rockets and display its x and y positions using suitable methods inside the class.
1. Class student having two methods with name set () but accepts different number of arguments. Include necessary methods to display the student details.
1. Function named readposint that uses the input dialog to prompt the user for a positive integer and then checks the input to confirm that it meets the requirements. It should be able to handle inputs that cannot be converted to int, as well as negative ints.
1. Program that accepts two numbers separated by comma and performs a division of two numbers. Include exceptions for the necessary conditions with finally clause.
1. Class to find the three elements that sum to zero from a set of n real numbers.
1. Program to compute the square root of a number. The input values must be tested for validity. if it is negative the user defined method MySqrt() should raise an exception.

1. Class to find a pair of elements (indices of the two numbers) from a given array whose sum equals a specific target number.
1. Class to reverse a string word by word.
Input string : 'hello .py'
Expected Output : '.py hello'
1. Class to get all possible unique subsets from a set of distinct integers.
1. Class which has two methods get_String and print_String. get_String accept a string from the user and print_String print the string in upper case.
1. Class to convert a roman numeral to an integer.
1. Class named Rectangle constructed by a length and width and a method which will compute the area of a rectangle.
1. Class to find a pair of elements (indices of the two numbers) from a given array whose sum equals a specific target number
Input: numbers= [10,20,10,40,50,60,70], Target=50, Output: 3, 4
